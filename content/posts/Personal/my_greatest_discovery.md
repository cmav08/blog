As someone keen on learning a lot, I have a habit of going down rabbit holes until I understand how certain concepts or systems work. This usually leads me to some interesting sources of information, and in this case I was pretty amazed. It all started when I was researching Instagram's usage of django and stumbled upon a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/i3zyx2/does_instagram_still_run_on_django/) from 2019 which had a similar topic. I then found a redditor in the comment referencing a blog which was supposed to explain the architecture of Instagram's server. Being inquinstive, I clicked the link to follow it and to my surprise it took me to a [medium blog](https://instagram-engineering.com/types-for-python-http-apis-an-instagram-story-d3c3a207fdb7) which was written by the instagram team. I was initially skeptical, but after snooping around some more blog posts, I realised that it was the real deal.
So then I thought, "if instagram has this, there should be a host of other companies that also do so" So, I headed to ChatGPT to get some more info and sure enough, it responded with a list of companies. Some of which included;

- [Meta(formerly known as facebook)](https://engineering.fb.com/)
- [X(formarly known as twitter)](https://blog.x.com/)
- [Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/blog)
- [Slack](https://slack.engineering/)
- [Spotify](https://engineering.atspotify.com/)
- [Github](https://github.blog/category/engineering/)
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/)
- [Netfix](https://netflixtechblog.com/)
- [Boston Dynamics](https://bostondynamics.com/blog/) and much more

These blogs are good sources of information and a great way to peak into the inner workings of enterprise grade systems. They contain various concepts in software engineering, ranging from frontend-architectures and large-scale API design to recommender systems and machine learning models, framework/library tips and more. Hope whoever stumbles upon this, finds it helpful.
