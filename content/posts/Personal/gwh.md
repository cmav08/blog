At the moment I am supposed to complete a feature for my team. It took me a while to trace my issues, but I am enjoying how much I have to learn. The whole team has been really supportive, especially my team lead, Athena. That is why I will not let them down and put in my best work because they deserve the best, and I must mandate the best out of myself everytime. Exciting times ahead.
