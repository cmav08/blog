	<p>As someone keen on learning a lot, I have a habit of going down rabbit holes until I understand how certain concepts or systems work. This usually leads me to some interesting sources of information, and in this case I was pretty amazed. It all started when I was researching Instagram&rsquo;s usage of django and stumbled upon a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/i3zyx2/does_instagram_still_run_on_django/">reddit post</a> from 2019 which had a similar topic. I then found a redditor in the comment referencing a blog which was supposed to explain the architecture of Instagram&rsquo;s server. Being inquinstive, I clicked the link to follow it and to my surprise it took me to a <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/types-for-python-http-apis-an-instagram-story-d3c3a207fdb7">medium blog</a> which was written by the instagram team. I was initially skeptical, but after snooping around some more blog posts, I realised that it was the real deal.
So then I thought, &ldquo;if instagram has this, there should be a host of other companies that also do so&rdquo; So, I headed to ChatGPT to get some more info and sure enough, it responded with a list of companies. Some of which included;</p>&hellip;

<p>Recently, I was working on a project which involved reporting on a major historical figure. Naturally, I took it as an opportunity to research two figures who I had always been intrigued by; Ada Lovelace and Linus Torvalds.</p>
<p>Let me start by saying, they are absolute f**king legends. Both started out their interests in their early years, and their contribution to the field of computer science is unparalleled by only a few.</p>&hellip;

	<p>At the moment, there&rsquo;s certainly a lot of hype around Large Language Models. And for good reasons, they&rsquo;ve unlocked several possibilities including text generation, advanced NLP, and who can forget agentic AI through JSON resopnses :|). However, a more overlooked but equally important area are the TTS and ASR models.</p>
<p>Apart from having the capacity to perform tasks more natural to the way we humans interact(through speech and listening), it can also bridge more gaps between non-technical individuals and technology products.</p>&hellip;

	<p>At the moment I am supposed to complete a feature for my team. It took me a while to trace my issues, but I am enjoying how much I have to learn. The whole team has been really supportive, especially my team lead, Athena. That is why I will not let them down and put in my best work because they deserve the best, and I must mandate the best out of myself everytime. Exciting times ahead.</p>&hellip;
