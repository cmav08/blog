          <p>At the moment, there&rsquo;s certainly a lot of hype around Large Language Models. And for good reasons, they&rsquo;ve unlocked several possibilities including text generation, advanced NLP, and who can forget agentic AI through JSON resopnses :|). However, a more overlooked but equally important area are the TTS and ASR models.</p>
<p>Apart from having the capacity to perform tasks more natural to the way we humans interact(through speech and listening), it can also bridge more gaps between non-technical individuals and technology products.</p>
<p>Take it from a key individual in artificial intelligence; Andrew NG. At the Langchain interrupt Conference, he says voice stack applications are &ldquo;so underrated&rdquo; and that &ldquo;user friction to just getting them(product users) to use it is lower&rdquo;. You can check out his full spitch at <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

<p>But that&rsquo;s not really what I&rsquo;m excited about. Instead, I am more enthralled by an organization making these advancements possible at home. <a href="https://spitch.app/">Spitch</a> headed by Temi Babs, have created the most production ready Text-To-Speech and Speech-To-Text models for Nigerian Languages. At the moment, they support;</p>
<ul>
<li>English</li>
<li>Yoruba</li>
<li>Igbo</li>
<li>Hausa</li>
<li>Armahic,..and they&rsquo;re still planning on adding more african languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, they have begun working on ensuring their models are aligned with frameworks/stacks that enable developers to seamlessly integrate their models into voice applications. Recently, they integrated their models into the Livekit framework (which you can learn more about <a href="https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/tts/spitch/">here</a>).</p>
<p>These moves, will allow for voice applications like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional Customer Support Agents.</li>
<li>Language learning platforms similar to Duolingo but for learning african languages.</li>
<li>Educational platforms that utilize TTS models for a better learning experiences.</li>
<li>Automatic Caption generation for content creation.</li>
<li>Transcription of meetings in various languages</li>
<li>Interactive and native virtual assistants</li>
<li>&hellip;and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, while companies like Openai, Google and Meta may amaze me with their innovations, home-based ones like Spitch excite and inspire me about the future of the Artificial Intelligence space.</p>
