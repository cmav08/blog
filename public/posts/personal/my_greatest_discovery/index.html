          <p>As someone keen on learning a lot, I have a habit of going down rabbit holes until I understand how certain concepts or systems work. This usually leads me to some interesting sources of information, and in this case I was pretty amazed. It all started when I was researching Instagram&rsquo;s usage of django and stumbled upon a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/i3zyx2/does_instagram_still_run_on_django/">reddit post</a> from 2019 which had a similar topic. I then found a redditor in the comment referencing a blog which was supposed to explain the architecture of Instagram&rsquo;s server. Being inquinstive, I clicked the link to follow it and to my surprise it took me to a <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/types-for-python-http-apis-an-instagram-story-d3c3a207fdb7">medium blog</a> which was written by the instagram team. I was initially skeptical, but after snooping around some more blog posts, I realised that it was the real deal.

<p>These blogs are good sources of information and a great way to peak into the inner workings of enterprise grade systems. They contain various concepts in software engineering, ranging from frontend-architectures and large-scale API design to recommender systems and machine learning models, framework/library tips and more. Hope whoever stumbles upon this, finds it helpful.</p>
